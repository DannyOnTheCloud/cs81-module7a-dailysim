# Reflection â€“ Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?

I chose activities that were relevant to my personal life that I actually do 
on a "Daily Basis" not things that sound fun. I asked myself, 
"If I where writting a diary, what would most of my days look like?". 
## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
Something that surprised me is how noticeable the time is even in seconds. 
The 3000ms mark did feel 3 times as much as the 1000ms mark 
I thought it would not be as noticeable. However, 
I think things become more noticeable when someone is waiting on things 
such as an output. 
## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
Unlike a regular script, that starts spreading output from top to bottom,
Asynchronous code allows for delays while still pushing everything out. 
One delay or pause did not pause everything else. 
TThis is really good for interactions and animations. 
For example if maybe when you are waiting for something simple like a timer
to count down the user can still interact with lets say a page instead of waiting
for said timer to expire. 
## What creative element did you add?
I added a random event that happened, also added things such as a playful
font and a diary as my background to give it that extra personal
touch. 
## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
This project simulates real life events by showing how time delays work. For example
if my time delay was set for 3 seconds we where in fact going to wait 3 seconds for that delay no matter what. Also 
I think it shows how the first thing most people do is.. wake up.
